                            <p class="mb-0">I love training with Sarah! She is incredibly positive and encouragingâ€”it's like having your own personal cheerleader while working out! Our workouts are hard but tons of fun and always aligned with my fitness goals. Sarah is super creative when planning our circuits for each training session, so things never get repetitive. She always takes time to explain each movement we do, saying which muscle groups it's targeting and demonstrating good form and breathing. She is great at pushing me past where I think my limits are, and she always does it with warmth and positivity. She also knows when to modify a workout to meet me where I am. As someone with a history of knee injuries, I especially appreciate that Sarah checks in on how my joints are feeling, and she designs our workouts specifically to strengthen the areas around my knees. My knees and legs are noticeably stronger since I started training with her, and my knee pain has decreased significantly. Whatever your fitness goals may be, I would highly recommend training with Sarah! </p>

                            <p>Sarah is a very attentive trainer and I appreciate how she challenges me, but somehow makes everything look so easy.  She is flexible with scheduling and is very easy to contact. I highly recommend Sarah as a coach or personal trainer for anyone trying to reach their personal fitness goals.

                            <p>I had never done weight/strength training before starting with Sarah--I was just an easy-going treadmill walker--but after a year of working with her I can't believe how much I like it. My goal was strength building, and she consistently pushed me to my goal and past it. She was great at compensating for my issues with carpal tunnel, allowing me to build strength and muscle in my upper body while protecting my wrists and paying attention to what my body was doing even when I wasn't. She's incredibly personable and friendly but absolutely firm about what you can achieve if you just focus and commit yourself to trying. If you want a trainer who will force you out of your comfort zone and help you meet your goals, without being a drill sergeant, Sarah is your trainer</p>

                            <p>I've had the pleasure of training with Sarah for a year.  She's a dynamic, inspirational, and creative trainer who will challenge what you think of as "fitness." While she's pushing you hard to improve your physical self, she's also takes a holistic approach and encourages you to work on your mental health.  I've lost weight, gained muscle mass and improved my balance and agility.  But I'm also a healthier person mentally and spiritually!</p>

                            <p>have been a client of Sarah Langer's for over a year, meeting twice weekly.  At sixty-one, I had normal conditions that come with age that I hoped to improve.  After listening to my history and goals I wished to attain, Sarah individualized a total-body workout for me that increased my strength, muscle tone, energy level, and wellbeing.  I even lost weight despite my general aversion to dieting.  As I grew stronger and my endurance increased, so too did the intensity of my workouts, which were never boring or mundane.  Because of Sarah's guidance, I have far exceeded my goals.  Notwithstanding her competency as a trainer, she is personable and an absolute joy to work with.  I confidently recommend Sarah as a personal trainer to anyone, who wishes to attain their goals.</p>
